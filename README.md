# TimeCapture

This app is a WIP, but should cover the basics.
  Any bugs and or ideas for features can either be sent to braydengls@gmail.com or shared on this forum.


# Plans for the future

1. Branching off ( Branch: 'Package')
     - Intend to create a branch that will be a paid subscription for companies and their staff. Will have login functionality and
       reporting systems for the management teams
     - The topic of license keys vs Flat Rate is still being decided - all opinions welcome
2. The Individual / Master
     - This is free, and will most likely always be free. A buy me a coffee system will be setup incase you feel generous but this isn't to start my own
       company, this was created because I was sick and tired of cruddy time capture apps that still want to charge you for simple functionality
3. The Automated time capture
     - The topic of Automated capture is a fun one, as everyone will have different sites where they capture time (it will most likely be limited to websites)
       This does mean that in order to do it I will need to go through the process of writing the selenium cases Specifically for you. This will happen if the
       site has any updates to UI as well.
     - This will most likely be a charged feature - but won't be more than R50 / $3 / â‚¬2.5 per hour

# Side Notes

I do have a website available, where both a copy of the release for individuals and a link to this GitHub repo will be available. once that is 
  done i will add the link to this readme
    Any bugs or ideas for that page can be emailed or commented here as well... this is all a hobby for me, there's probably alot of things I should do better
