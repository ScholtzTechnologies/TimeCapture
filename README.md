# TimeCapture

This app is a WIP, but should cover the basics.
  Any bugs and or ideas for features can either be sent to braydengls@gmail.com or shared on this forum.


# Plans for the future

1. Branching off ( Branch: 'Package')
     Intend to create a branch that will be a paid subscription for companies and their staff. Will have login functionality and
       reporting systems for the management teams
     The topic of license keys vs Flat Rate is still being decided - all opinions welcome
2. The Individual / Master
     - This is free, and will most likely always be free. A buy me a coffee system will be setup incase you feel generous but this isn't to start my own
       company, this was created because I was sick and tired of cruddy time capture apps that still want to charge you for simple functionality
     Intend to Grow this more and more
3. The Automated time capture
     The topic of Automated capture is a fun one, as everyone will have different sites where they capture time (it will most likely be limited to websites)
       This does mean that in order to do it I will need to go through the process of writing the selenium cases Specifically for you. This will happen if the
       site has any updates to UI as well.
     This will most likely be a charged feature - but won't be more than R50 / $3 / â‚¬2.5

# Side Notes

I do have a website available, where both a copy of the release for individuals and a link to this GitHub repo will be available. once that is 
  done i will add the link to this readme
    Any bugs or ideas for that page can be emailed or commented here as well... this is all a hobby for me, there's probably alot of things I should do better
